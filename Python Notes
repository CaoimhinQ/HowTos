Naming
  Function naming rules: 
  lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary
  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names
  
  Class naming:
    Capitalized camel case only used for python class names.
  
  global variables:
    UPPERCASE 

comparisons and operators
  when using None use is rather than ==
  
File Handling
  always close the file if opened or use With statement which will close file automaticaly:
    with open('/etc/hosts') as hosts_file:
    for line in hosts_file:
      ...
  check a file exists:
    if os.path.exists("/file-path"):
    


For loops
  continue to skip the rest of the logic and go back to the next iteration of the for loop
  
Functions
  if there is no return it returns None by default
